# Exercises

The purpose of this readme is to start working with the exercises with an already opened visual studio code environment.

## Setting up the environment

- Please make sure you have the test menu in the left side of the screen. If not try reloading the page or the desktop application.

## Starting with the exercises

### Example

Check the `example` folder which contains:

- `example.ts` file with two simple functions
- `example.test.ts` file with a test for those functions

## Fixing our first test

You should be able to see the results of the tests in the `Test` panel. At this moment, `example.test.ts` should be working, and `ej1.test.ts` should be failing.

If you go directly to the `ej1.test.ts` file, you should see a red icon, showing that the test is failing. If you go to the function in`ej1.ts` and fix the issue, it should appear green now :) Congratulations! You fixed your first test!

## Exercises requirements

The requirement for these exercises is to create each function in each exercise and then a proper test for it. Take your time to write your tests, what are our corner cases?
